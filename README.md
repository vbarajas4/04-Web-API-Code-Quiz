# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz
[github live page](https://vbarajas4.github.io/04-Web-API-Code-Quiz/.)


## User Story

AS A coding boot camp student

I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores

SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Project Outline

We were asked to build a timed quiz in which it would challenge our understanding in Web API.
The application contains a start button that starts a timed quiz, in which it delivers a number of 
questions. For each question you get correct, you get a point. For every question you get wrong, 
you get 10 seconds deducted from your total time left. Once the array of questions comes to an end, 
the quiz ends and it then gives your total score and gives you an input to put your initials to 
submit. Your score is then saved to the Local Storage in your computer browser and prints it in a 
highscore list.
